The Library of Cringe.

YouTube these days feels so sheet :\ . It makes me upset that YouTube created YouTube Kids.
And sure it did help some kids English or something but still... It's insanely garbage.
So I created a small library of cringe.
It's mostly related to cringe, but it can contain these:
- "Free Robux"
- "Burning-Sight Images"
   et cetera.

So... yeah. You can download the zip if you dare watch I guess.
